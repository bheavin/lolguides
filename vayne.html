                    and a basic understanding of what the champion does in the game. If you do not understand what Vayne does, I would recommend looking
                    at <a link href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Vayne/LoL" target="_blank">Vayne's Wiki Page</a> and/or playing the game more.

                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Strengths Include:</p></div>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Tank-shredding</li>

                        <li>Strong scaling</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Weaknesses Include:</p></div>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Short range</li>
                        <li>High economy</li>
                        <li>Weak laning</li>
                        <li>Single-target</li>
                        <li>Mediocre teamfighting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Ideal Team</p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice"><p>With these given strengths and weaknesses, we can conclude that Vayne wants to play with a team that can enable her and let her get
                    the majority of farm from minions and jungle camps during the mid-late game. Vayne essentially wants to play with a low-economy team who can enable her to carry by
                    buffing, healing, shielding, or peeling her.
                    </p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Biggest Counter(s)</p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice"><p>Due to Vayne's biggest counter being range, you want to avoid picking Vayne into teams with more range than you, examples being
                    ranged mages and enchanters such as Vel'Koz and Nami.</p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice"><p>Another big counter to Vayne is anything that limits her movement and kiting. Movement and kiting are a huge strength to Vayne,
                    so it is important to not pick her into champions that can limit your movement or kiting abilities such as Nasus, Veigar, Ashe, Malzahar, or Orianna. 
                    </p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Botlane Synergies</p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice"><p>Vayne is somewhat flexible when it comes to her support synergies. She can work well with engage supports such as
                    Nautilus or Leona. She also works well with enchanters such as Yuumi, Nami, or Lulu. However, make sure to not pick Vayne when your support is a mage carry support
                    such as Xerath or Vel'Koz. This type of support provides nothing to Vayne, and makes her laning 10x more difficult (unless they are very very good).
                    </p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice-list"><p>Vayne's Botlane Counters</p></div>
                    <div class="calm-voice"><p>As stated previously, Vayne is hard countered by range. This makes it very difficult to play her into ranged supports. She is countered
                    by every ranged support in the game, with no exceptions. As for ADC matchups, she can work well into champions that cannot bully her for cs'ing, such as Kai'Sa, Ezreal,
                    or Zeri. However, in a vacuum, all of Vayne's ADC matchups are playable. Vayne's matchups are highly dependent on the supports. She can do very poorly into
                    Kai'Sa, Ezreal, or Zeri if the support matchup is skewed.
